Yang' license

I am happy to share the codes and feel free to ask me any kinds of questions.
You can download the codes for learning but don't use it for any kinds of commercial purposes.
Please delete it when you finishing learning, it is not only to protect my rights, but also push youself 
to understand the algorithms better and write your own magic codes.

Contact me if you are not sure that you use it as a right way,
my email: yangyang01011001@gmail.com

I hope everyone can find something interesting and useful here and have fun on programming!
